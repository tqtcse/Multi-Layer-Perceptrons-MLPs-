# Multi-layer-perceptrons

## Introduction

This project aims to develop data structures and utilize them to create applications focused on neural networks and deep learning. The project is divided into three main phases, each building upon the previous one to ensure continuity and integration.

## Objectives and Tasks

### Phase 1: List Data Structures and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Develop List Data Structures**: Implement array-based and linked list data structures (XArrayList and DLinkedList).
- **Utilize xtensor Library**: Perform various tasks on multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) using the xtensor library.
- **Build MLP Library**: Create a library of classes to help users develop and use multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks.

### Phase 2: Hash-Table and Heap Data Structures
- **Develop Hash-Table and Heap**: Implement hash-table and heap data structures (XHashMap and Heap).
- **Support Neural Network Training**: Use these data structures to facilitate the training of neural networks.

### Phase 3: Graph Data Structures and Computational Graphs
- **Develop Graph Data Structures**: Implement directed graph data structures and algorithms.
- **Build Computational Graph Library**: Use graph data structures to create a computational graph library for deep learning applications.

## Methodology

1. **Preparation**: Download and understand the provided source code. Ensure compatibility with C++17.
2. **Using xtensor Library**: Refer to the course page for demos and guides on using the xtensor library.
3. **Develop Lists**: Implement XArrayList and DLinkedList in the `/include/list` directory.
4. **Develop and Use MLP Library**: Follow the course page guides to implement MLP neural network classes in the `/include/ann` directory.
5. **Testing**: Verify the program against provided sample test cases.
6. **Submission**: Submit the project on the system before the deadline.

## Deliverables

Upon completion, the project will enable:
- Advanced C/C++ programming skills.
- Effective use of programming libraries, specifically xtensor.
- Development of list data structures in both array-based and linked list forms.
- Application of lists to develop a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network library.

## Version History

- **09/09/2024**: Version 1.0 released.
