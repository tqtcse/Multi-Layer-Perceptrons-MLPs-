# Multi-layer-perceptrons

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to creating and utilizing data structures to build applications focused on neural networks and deep learning. The development process is divided into three sequential phases, each enhancing the functionality and ensuring a cohesive integration of components.

## Objectives

### Phase 1: List Data Structures and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Develop List Data Structures**: Design array-based and linked list implementations (XArrayList and DLinkedList).
- **Utilize xtensor Library**: Perform tensor operations on multi-dimensional arrays with the xtensor library.
- **Build MLP Library**: Develop a library of classes to construct and manage multi-layer perceptron neural networks.

### Phase 2: Hash Tables and Heaps
- **Develop Hash-Table and Heap**: Implement hash tables and heaps (XHashMap and Heap) for efficient data management.
- **Support Neural Network Training**: Use these structures to support and improve training processes.

### Phase 3: Graphs and Computational Graphs
- **Develop Graph Data Structures**: Implement directed graph data structures and algorithms for data modeling.
- **Build Computational Graph Library**: Create a library to handle computational graphs, supporting advanced deep learning workflows.

## Methodology

1. **Preparation**: Download and understand the provided source code. Ensure compatibility with C++17.
2. **Using xtensor Library**: Refer to the course page for demos and guides on using the xtensor library.
3. **Develop Lists**: Implement XArrayList and DLinkedList in the `/include/list` directory.
4. **Develop and Use MLP Library**: Follow the course page guides to implement MLP neural network classes in the `/include/ann` directory.
5. **Testing**: Verify the program against provided sample test cases.
6. **Submission**: Submit the project on the system before the deadline.

## Deliverables

Upon completion, the project will enable:
- Advanced C/C++ programming skills.
- Effective use of programming libraries, specifically xtensor.
- Development of list data structures in both array-based and linked list forms.
- Application of lists to develop a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network library.
